# Firebase Realtime Database: Maximum call stack size exceeded

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase Realtime Database where a `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` error can occur due to recursive operations on deeply nested data or circular references. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that leads to the error, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected approach to prevent the stack overflow.

The problem arises when the recursive function calls itself repeatedly without a proper base case, causing the call stack to grow unboundedly. This leads to the `RangeError`. The solution involves implementing clear base cases and potentially optimizing data structures or traversal methods for better performance.
